# dotfiles
<br>
This is a work-in-progress setup of Arch Linux on a laptop with 3 window managers: i3, Qtile and OpenBox.
<br>
Run ./install.sh to set up your system (preferably on a fresh Arch Linux install).
<br>
Enter your password when asked (required to install dependencies).
<br><br>
IMPORTANT<br>
Your monitor setup will most likely be different from mine, so replace the files from ./screenlayout with ones that work properly for your setup. You can generate those using arandr, just make sure to save them in the right place (~/Source/personal/dotfiles/screenlayout).
